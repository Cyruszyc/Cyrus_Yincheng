### Q: How might we “ensure sustainable consumption and production”?

#### Idea1: 
1.Waste Recycle App：
Use the app to scan the waste, and the app will inform the user what kind of material it is, can it be recycled or not, and where to put it. Users can take the waste to the nearest collection point and get cash rewards, which they can use to purchase goods again or donate to some environmental protection projects. Besides, users’recycling history can be recorded and visualized, showing them the amount of each type of recycled garbage (like plastic, metal and the like), and the proportion of recycling and disposable use.

2.Free Food Sharing App
Share superabundant food for free with people nearby.
Idea2: Personally speaking, I think the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research very well because of its nice interface and convenient search bar. In the homepage, the main categories of Hansard and the search bar are at the top of the site, which looks bold. If you scroll down, you could see quick links that guide you want to go quickly. And the transcripts of the latest House of sitting are divided into two main chambers, Commons and Hansard. More importantly, it provides the time filter for researchers to find the exact document of each day. But on the homepage, you could see some featured news that are irrelevant, such as shops news or latest products, which may confuse people who want to search document to some extent.


#### Idea2:
Waste Recycling App：
Two functions
1. Collects large items of waste from people's lives and pays for it. There are four main categories: clothing recycling, electronics recycling, furniture recycling and large appliances recycling. Because these four have a certain economic value, and people are not particularly good at handling them in their lives. People can make appointments in our app for specialised staff to come to their homes and settle the payment on the spot.
2. Provide standards for waste separation. In addition to large items of rubbish, there are also standards for the separation of small items of rubbish. This is partly because some cities have already made it a requirement to separate waste, but it can be difficult for people to identify which waste belongs where. Our app can help with this. On the other hand, people nowadays rarely accumulate waste such as plastic bottles and cardboard boxes for recycling. It is difficult to go for door-to-door recycling.

#### Idea3:
【Function of "Reduce E-waste" APP】
1.Before purchasing electronic products
· users scan the product that they would like to buy, getting information about products' metal content, life 
· knowing how to use products in a life-long way


2. When using electronic products
· help prolonged the age of electronic products - provide reminder, tips
· track the way users use it


3. When electronic pruducts' life come to an end
· using app to contact specilist for a free door-step recycling collection/ getting nearest location for recycling
· create a reference number for products, by using it users may know the track of their products
· get green point which allows users to pay electronic products by those points

#### idea4:
Based on the Target 12.2: Sustainable management and use of natural resources

Management and use of fossil fuels of private cars App

Functions 

1. Educate drivers to not waste fuels. Uploading videos constantly about climate change problems with the consumption of fuels and the knowledge tips about how to manage usage of our fossil fuels. In addition, design a game about knowledge of the negative impact of fossil fuels and rank player per day. Give some reward to those who have high scores every month.
2. Monitor the consumption of fossil fuels created by private cars. Link every private car that uses fuels or hybrids to our App to monitor the consumption of fuels. Show the data of consumption of fuels caused by per private car constantly in domestic and global perspective. In addition, show the average domestic and global consumption of fossil fuels to let every citizen directly see whether they do well in managing fossil fuels. For those people who are below the average, governments and companies could implement some subsidies policy to award them, such as lower car insurance fees.

#### Idea5:
Food Save App

Supermarkets sell food that is about to expire at a discount

The customer can purchase the food nearly expiration online at a lower price to avoid inventory waste in the markets.

Food Saving Community

Customers post in the online community that they are saving food or packing restaurant leftovers.

At the end of a diner's meal, they can choose to sell a particular dish that they have not eaten. People near the restaurants are able to browse the news  according to app and get the food at a very low price if they wish.

Both the buyer and seller can be rewarded by the platform after the transaction is completed, such as points or vouchers that can be used to buy other food in the app. These foods are also from slow-moving produce from farmers or factories.

Online Sales for Stagnant

In markets where supply often exceeds demand, farmers or factories that do not accurately anticipate market signals would waste tons of products.

The app will provide an online sales channel to help solve the problem of stagnant sales.
